Guardrail change: capture provider sessions at lane close with exact Solo process marker joins; archive staged captures without re-extraction; block named-lane finalization when no healthy capture or explicit waiver exists

## Signal

Agent-session preservation was previously resolved during session archive, after
the Solo process row and runtime-scoped identity could already be gone. That
made capture fragile and let empty or wrong provider archives look acceptable,
especially when a parent orchestrator transcript contained a child worker's Solo
marker text.

## Prior Occurrences

This is adjacent to
`harness-signals/2026-06-25-required-verification-finalization-gap.md`: both
concern finalization proof, but this record covers whether the worker/reviewer
session evidence exists and belongs to the named lane.

## Missing Guardrail

The harness did not require lane-close capture while the Solo process row was
alive, did not distinguish exact spawned-runtime markers from arbitrary
transcript mentions, and allowed finalization to proceed with zero healthy
captures unless a reviewer noticed the archive contents manually.

## Guardrail Change

- `bin/orbit-agent-session-capture` stages provider artifacts by exact
  `Solo process ID: <id>` marker joins during lane close.
- `bin/orbit-session-archive` prefers staged `.orbit/agent-sessions/` captures
  and uses archive-time extraction only as a no-staging fallback.
- `bin/orbit-codex-pre-tool-use-hook` and `bin/orbit-feature-finalization-check`
  block named worker/reviewer/analyzer lanes when active or archived manifests
  contain zero healthy captures and no explicit waiver row.
- `HARNESS.md`, `LOOP.md.example`, and the implementation skill now document
  the lane-close capture and waiver contract.

## Verification

```bash
bin/orbit-gateway-pest --compact --filter=AgentSessionArchive
bin/orbit-gateway-pest --compact --filter=SessionArchive
bin/orbit-gateway-pest --compact --filter=FeatureFinalizationGate
bin/orbit-agent-session-capture 801 --orbit-dir=.orbit --cwd=/Users/nckrtl/orbit/.worktrees/lane-close-agent-session-capture --slug=lane-close-capture-worker-801
```

The live capture command staged a real Solo-spawned Grok worker session with
`status: ok` under `.orbit/agent-sessions/grok/lane-close-capture-worker-801/`.

## Reappearance Check

If a future feature loop names Solo worker/reviewer/analyzer lanes but the
session archive has zero healthy captures, inspect whether lane-close capture
was skipped, whether the provider is unsupported and needs a waiver, or whether
the exact marker parser missed a runtime-specific prompt shape. Tighten the
capture helper and add a provider fixture before weakening finalization.

## Curation Notes

Keep separate from required-verification finalization gaps. This record is
about preserving the underlying agent-session evidence, not whether generic
verification rows were filled.
